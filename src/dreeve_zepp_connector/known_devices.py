"""Static `deviceSource` -> model-name table.

Zepp's workout API exposes no device-model field at all (see the
`ZEPP_DEVICE_NAMES` quirk in CLAUDE.md) - `devicesource` is just an opaque
per-physical-device ID. This table lets common devices resolve to a real
name without the user having to set `ZEPP_DEVICE_NAMES` themselves.

Scraped (2026-08-31) from Zepp's own developer docs, which is the only
public source that documents this mapping:
https://docs.zepp.com/docs/1.0/reference/related-resources/device-list/
("Devices with Zepp OS" + "Devices without Zepp OS" tables, both keyed by
`deviceSource`) - parsed from the page's raw server-rendered HTML, not an
AI paraphrase. Verbatim except for three entries ("Active 2 (Round)",
"Active 3 Premium", "Cheetah 2 Pro") where the doc's own "Equipment name"
column omits the "Amazfit" brand prefix inconsistently with every other
row in the same table - prefixed here for consistency. The doc also marks
some IDs with a trailing `*` (e.g. `9568512*`) footnoted as "represents the
device version for Mainland China" - that's an annotation on the ID, not
part of the number or a wildcard, so it's stripped before use here; the
China-variant ID is included as a normal key like every other regional ID
for the same model, just without the asterisk. Confirmed live: hitting
huami-token's plaintext `GET https://api-mifit.zepp.com/users/{user_id}/devices`
endpoint (see zepp-mcp's `huami_client.HuamiClient.devices()` /
`huami_token.zepp.ZeppClient.get_devices()`) against a real account returns
each device's `deviceSource` plus `productId`/`deviceId`/`sn` - but no
human-readable model name field either, so calling that endpoint at runtime
wouldn't add anything over this static table; not wired up here.

Not exhaustive - new devices ship after this was scraped, and non-Zepp-OS
devices are only partially documented there. `ZEPP_DEVICE_NAMES` still
exists to override any entry here or add a `deviceSource` this table
doesn't know about.
